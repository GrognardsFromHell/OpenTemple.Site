# OpenTemple Site

We are using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) static site generator
together with the  [Docsy theme](https://github.com/google/docsy).

## Running the website locally

Once you've cloned the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```
