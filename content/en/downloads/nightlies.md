# <i class="fas fa-moon"></i> Nightly Builds

We provide fully automated builds of the latest OpenTemple code for testing and development purposes.

Please keep in mind that these builds may be outright broken or corrupt your save games. In case you have
any valuable save data, <em>please back it up</em> before using a nightly build!
